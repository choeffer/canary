# canary
Start of the implementation of the offline mode of CANARY Water Quality Event Detection Tool https://software.sandia.gov/trac/canary in R. Baseline change/reset window or anything related to the pattern library are not part of the implementation right now. Because the structure of the offline mode is implemented in R from scratch without looking at the JAVA/Matlab code of CANARY, the implementation is not guarenteed to behave exactly the same as CANARY.
